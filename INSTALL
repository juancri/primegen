Like any other piece of software (and information generally), primegen
comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* The primegen home directory, normally /usr/local. To change this
directory, edit conf-home now.

* The compiler to use, normally gcc -O1 -fomit-frame-pointer. To change
this compiler, edit conf-cc now.

* The number of 32-bit words of space used in the primegen inner loop,
normally 2048. To change this number, edit conf-words now.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs and create the formatted man pages:
       % make

 2. Install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup check


How to test:

 3. If you have the md5 program installed:
       % ./primes 1 100000000 | md5
    The result should be 4e2b0027288a27e9c99699364877c9db. (There are
    5761455 primes up to 10^8.)


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
